>>> On Homepage slider with id=1 is used. By default, this is the first option from the dropdown (if you didn't remove slider with id=1)
6. If the Slider with `id=1` has been removed for some reasons or you want to use another slider on Homepage you can change the slider's id in the Homepage: Go to `Admin > Content > Pages >  Homepage > Design tab > Layout Update Xml` and change slider_id as shows on screenshot
