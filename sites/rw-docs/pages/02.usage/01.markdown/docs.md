**Markdown** is a better way to write **HTML**, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it.

Some of the key benefits are:

1. Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters so it's also quicker to write content.
2. Less chance of errors when writing in markdown.
3. Produces valid XHTML output.
4. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site.
5. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like.
6. Markdown is a joy to use!

Grav ships with built-in support for [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/). You must enable **Markdown Extra** in your `system.yaml` configuration file
