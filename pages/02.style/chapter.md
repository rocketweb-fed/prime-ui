## Style Components
Style components are files that contain style rules for a distinct element along with variables and mixins. They can be broken down into 3 groups:
* **elements** - independent modular objects that have no children elements, but can have modifier states that change their appearance (eg.: buttons, thumbnails)
* **modules** - also known as patterns, are objects that have children, all of which are affected by the parent object (eg.: header, header logo, header nav)
* **globals** - contain global styles that affect all UI elements
